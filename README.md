Project title - Chopped Quarantine Edition (Working Title); RecipeHound -- Hound dogs are known for their searching skills, searching for everything from truffles to missing people.

Project desciption - creating a food app that provides you recipes based on available ingredients within your household

User story - everyone likes food, but not everyone likes to cook; As a human, I need to eat. Coming up with unique meal ideas based on whatâ€™s in my kitchen is a nearly impossible task. I want to make this daily task easier by finding recipes by searching for proteins, vegetables, starches, calorie counts, etc.

Wireframe ideas / sketch of the design (at least have an idea how how you -would like it laid out) - 

APIs to be used: Recipe - Food - Nutrition (https://spoonacular.com/food-api), Cocktail DB (https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php), Weather API

Rough break down of tasks: 

    - (ALL) determine the capabilities of each API and how we want to apply it to our app
    - Psuedo Code each file (HTML, CSS, Java)
    - Research another CSS Framework we can apply for the APP (Foundation, Bulma, Ulkit, Tailwind)
    - (Ben and Callie[wants to be part of everything]) Page Layout and Design will be the last step.
